# 📰 Fake News Detection Using Python 

This project is a machine learning-based solution to detect fake news articles using natural language processing techniques. It uses a dataset from Kaggle and Python-based libraries to build a binary classifier that predicts whether a news article is real or fake.

## 📌 Features

- Download dataset directly via Kaggle API
- Text preprocessing and cleaning (stopwords removal, stemming, etc.)
- Vectorization (TF-IDF or CountVectorizer)
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Easy-to-run and modular code.
